# NutriCal:McDonald-s-Menu-Nutritional-Analysis

❖Acknowledgment:

 I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to "Mr Abhisheik Saraswat" for helping me to understand python because of you i am able to do this project on nutritional analysis  McDonald's menu.

 First and foremost, I extend my thanks to Upgrad platform team and my team buddy Aditi who provided the dataset used for this analysis. This valuable data formed the foundation of my exploration and insights into

 the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items.

 I would also like to express my gratitude to the Open Source community for the development of essential tools and libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, which played a crucial role in the data

 analysis and visualization processes.

 Sincerely,

 Vijay Prakash



❖Problem Statement:

 McDonald's is a global fast-food chain known for its diverse menu offerings. As a data analyst, your task is to analyze the nutritional content of the menu items available at McDonald's outlets. This analysis
 will provide valuable insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items.


❖Objectives:

      1.   Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
      2.   Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
      3.   Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
      4.   Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.
